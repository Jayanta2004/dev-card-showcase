- **Weather Prediction Engine**: 7-day forecast with agricultural impact analysis
- **Alert System**: Automated notifications for critical conditions
- **Regional Data Integration**: Location-based climate patterns
- **Historical Analytics**: Trend analysis for better planning

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5 Canvas**: Real-time crop field visualization
- **JavaScript ES6+**: Predictive algorithms and data processing
- **CSS3 Animations**: Interactive weather and health indicators
- **Local Storage**: Offline data persistence for field conditions

## 📊 Data Sources

- Simulated satellite imagery data
- Weather API integration (mock data)
- Soil moisture sensor readings
- Historical crop yield patterns

## 🎮 Usage

1. Select your crop type and location
2. View real-time health metrics on the interactive field map
3. Monitor weather forecasts and stress predictions
4. Receive automated alerts for intervention needs
5. Export reports for cooperative sharing

## 🌱 Agricultural Impact

- Early detection of drought stress
- Pest outbreak prevention
- Optimized irrigation scheduling
- Improved yield prediction
- Community-based decision support

## 🔬 Technical Implementation

The system uses predictive algorithms that analyze:
- NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) from satellite data
- Soil moisture levels and drainage patterns
- Temperature and humidity correlations
- Historical pest outbreak patterns

Alerts are generated when stress indicators exceed threshold values, providing farmers with timely intervention recommendations.
